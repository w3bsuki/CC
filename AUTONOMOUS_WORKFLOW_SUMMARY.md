# Autonomous Agent Workflow Summary

## Phase 3 Autonomous Configuration Complete

### Agent Configuration Summary
✅ **PRD Agent** - `/agents/prd/claude.md`
✅ **Architect Agent** - `/agents/architect/claude.md`  
✅ **Builder Agent** - `/agents/builder/claude.md`
✅ **QA Agent** - `/agents/qa/claude.md`
✅ **MCP Configuration** - Each agent has `claude_mcp_config.json`

### Autonomous Workflow Sequence

#### 1. PRD Agent (Entry Point)
- **Trigger**: New requirements file in `/workspace/shared/requirements/`
- **Focus**: Mobile Commander requirements analysis
- **Output**: `analysis.json`, `prd.md`, `prd-agent-status.json`
- **Exit**: Signals "PRD_COMPLETE"

#### 2. Architect Agent (Research-First)
- **Trigger**: PRD_COMPLETE status detected
- **Focus**: Tech stack research + Mobile Commander architecture
- **Research Phase**: Context7 for latest React Native, TypeScript, mobile patterns
- **Output**: `tech-stack.json`, `system-architecture.json`, `api-specification.json`
- **Exit**: Signals "ARCHITECTURE_COMPLETE"

#### 3. Builder Agent (Implementation)
- **Trigger**: ARCHITECTURE_COMPLETE status detected
- **Focus**: Complete Mobile Commander React Native app build
- **Implementation**: Full feature set from PRD + architecture specs
- **Output**: Complete app in `/workspace/projects/mobile-commander/`
- **Exit**: Signals "BUILD_COMPLETE"

#### 4. QA Agent (Quality Assurance)
- **Trigger**: BUILD_COMPLETE status detected
- **Focus**: Comprehensive testing and quality validation
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, mobile-specific, performance, security
- **Output**: Test reports, coverage analysis, quality gates validation
- **Exit**: Signals "QA_COMPLETE" (Production Ready)

### Key Autonomous Features

#### No Human Interaction Required
- Self-triggering based on file system events
- Autonomous error handling and recovery
- Auto-progression through workflow stages
- Self-monitoring and status reporting

#### Mobile Commander Priority #1
- All agents optimized for React Native development
- Focus on agent management and real-time communication
- Cross-platform mobile optimization
- Production-ready output standards

#### MCP Tool Integration
- **filesystem**: File operations and code management
- **shared-context**: Inter-agent status communication
- **task-queue**: Task management and coordination
- **context7**: Latest technology research (Architect agent)

### Workflow Trigger Files
```
/workspace/shared/requirements/    → PRD Agent starts
/workspace/shared/context/prd-agent-status.json    → Architect Agent starts
/workspace/shared/context/architect-status.json    → Builder Agent starts
/workspace/shared/context/builder-status.json    → QA Agent starts
/workspace/shared/context/qa-status.json    → Workflow complete
```

### Expected Timeline (Autonomous)
1. **PRD Agent**: 5-10 minutes (requirements analysis)
2. **Architect Agent**: 15-20 minutes (research + architecture)
3. **Builder Agent**: 30-45 minutes (full app implementation)
4. **QA Agent**: 15-25 minutes (comprehensive testing)
5. **Total**: ~65-100 minutes for complete Mobile Commander app

### Quality Standards
- TypeScript strict mode
- 80%+ test coverage
- Mobile performance optimization
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Production deployment readiness

## Execution Ready
The autonomous system is configured and ready for Mobile Commander development. Simply place requirements in `/workspace/shared/requirements/` to initiate the full autonomous workflow.

**Next Step**: Deploy autonomous system with file watchers and agent launchers.
